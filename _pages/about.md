I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) advised by Prof. [Lifu Huang](https://wilburone.github.io/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree in the [School of CSE](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). I was a Research Intern at Microsoft in the Summer 2024 and an Applied Scientist Intern at AWS AI in the Summer 2023.

<!-- Previously, I was a research assistant at SCUT Machine Intelligence Lab (SMIL), working closely with Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. Qing Du. I also worked with Prof. [Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage) at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm). Besides, I spent wonderful five months as an exchange student in the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). --> 

**I am actively looking for research internship positions in the Summer 2025. Please reach out if you're interested!**


## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the field of **NLP** and **multimodal learning**. Currently, I am interested in the following topics: <br>
<!-- 1) **Language technology for real-world applications:** continual learning and few/zero-shot learning for NLP; <br> -->
1) **Evaluation** for large language models and vision-language models;  <br>
2) **Multi-modal learning, reasoning, and generation**; <br> 
3) **Continual learning for NLP**: acquiring new knowledge from evolving data while retaining previously learned knowledge. <br>
<!-- 2) **Interactive learning for NLP**: continually improving the machine learning system over time with demonstrations, corrections, or feedback from users; <br> -->
<!-- 3) **Knowledge-driven information extraction:** extracting structured information from text empowered by external knowledge sources. -->
<!-- 3) **Natural language generation:** text summarization, machine translation, and automatic evaluation for text generation. <br> -->
