I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), advised by Prof. [Lifu Huang](https://wilburone.github.io/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree in the [School of CSE](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/), [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). I was a research intern at Bloomberg CTO Office in the Summer 2025, a Research Intern at Microsoft in the Summer 2024, and an Applied Scientist Intern at AWS AI in the Summer 2023.

<span style="color: #e5383b;">**I am currently on the job market and actively seeking full-time research scientist positions in large language models, multimodal learning, and AI safety. Please reach out if you would like to connect!**</span>

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the field of **NLP** and **multimodal learning**. Currently, I am interested in the following topics: <br>
<!-- 1) **Language technology for real-world applications:** continual learning and few/zero-shot learning for NLP; <br> -->
1) **Evaluation** for large language models and vision-language models;  <br>
2) **AI Safety**, e.g., alignment and content moderation for large language models; <br>
3) **Multi-modal learning, reasoning, and generation**; <br> 
4) **Continual learning for NLP**: acquiring new knowledge from evolving data while retaining previously learned knowledge. <br>
<!-- 2) **Interactive learning for NLP**: continually improving the machine learning system over time with demonstrations, corrections, or feedback from users; <br> -->
<!-- 3) **Knowledge-driven information extraction:** extracting structured information from text empowered by external knowledge sources. -->
<!-- 3) **Natural language generation:** text summarization, machine translation, and automatic evaluation for text generation. <br> -->
